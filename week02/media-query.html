            <p>Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men
                that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that
                he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.</p>

            <p>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be
                right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel
                that it is right.</p>
